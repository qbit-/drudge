    # Substitution
    #

        """Substitute the all appearance of the defined tensor.

        When the given LHS is a plain SymPy symbol, all its appearances in the
        amplitude of the tensor will be replaced.  Or the LHS can also be
        indexed SymPy expression or indexed Vector, for which all of the
        appearances of the indexed base or vector base will be attempted to be
        matched against the indices on the LHS.  When a matching succeeds for
        all the indices, the RHS, with the substitution found in the matching
        performed, will be replace the indexed base in the amplitude, or the
        vector.  Note that for scalar LHS, the RHS must contain no vector.

        Since we do not commonly define tensors with wild symbols, an option
        ``wilds`` can be used to give a mapping translating plain symbols on the
        LHS and the RHS to the wild symbols that would like to be used.  The
        default value of None could make all **plain** symbols in the indices of
        the LHS to be translated into a wild symbol with the same name and no
        exclusion. And empty dictionary can be used to disable all such
        automatic translation.  The default value of None should satisfy most
        needs.

        Examples
        --------

        For instance, we can have a very simple tensor, the outer product of the
        same vector,

        .. doctest::

            >>> dr = Drudge(SparkContext())
            >>> r = Range('R')
            >>> a, b = dr.set_dumms(r, symbols('a b c d e f'))[:2]
            >>> dr.add_default_resolver(r)
            >>> x = IndexedBase('x')
            >>> v = Vec('v')
            >>> tensor = dr.einst(x[a] * x[b] * v[a] * v[b])
            >>> str(tensor)
            'sum_{a, b} x[a]*x[b] * v[a] * v[b]'

        We can replace the indexed base by the product of a matrix with another
        indexed base,

        .. doctest::

            >>> o = IndexedBase('o')
            >>> y = IndexedBase('y')
            >>> res = tensor.subst(x[a], dr.einst(o[a, b] * y[b]))
            >>> str(res)
            'sum_{a, b, c, d} y[c]*y[d]*o[a, c]*o[b, d] * v[a] * v[b]'

        We can also make substitution on the vectors,

        .. doctest::

            >>> w = Vec('w')
            >>> res = tensor.subst(v[a], dr.einst(o[a, b] * w[b]))
            >>> str(res)
            'sum_{a, b, c, d} x[a]*x[b]*o[a, c]*o[b, d] * w[c] * w[d]'

        After the substitution, we can always make a simplification, at least to
        make the naming of the dummies more aesthetically pleasing,

        .. doctest::

            >>> res = res.simplify()
            >>> str(res)
            'sum_{a, b, c, d} x[c]*x[d]*o[c, a]*o[d, b] * w[a] * w[b]'

        """Create a tensor for the given summation.

        This is the core function for creating tensors from scratch.  The
        arguments should start with the summations, each of which should be
        given as a sequence, normally a tuple, starting with a SymPy symbol for
        the summation dummy in the first entry.  Then comes possibly multiple
        domains that the dummy is going to be summed over, which can be symbolic
        range, SymPy expression, or iterable over them.  When symbolic ranges
        are given as :py:class:`Range` objects, the given dummy will be set to
        be summed over the ranges symbolically.  When SymPy expressions are
        given, the given values will substitute all appearances of the dummy in
        the summand.  When we have multiple summations, terms in the result are
        generated from the Cartesian product of them.

        The last argument should give the actual thing to be summed, which can
        be something that can be interpreted as a collection of terms, or a
        callable that is going to return the summand when given a dictionary
        giving the action on each of the dummies.  The dictionary has an entry
        for all the dummies.  Dummies summed over symbolic ranges will have the
        actual range as its value, or the actual SymPy expression when it is
        given a concrete range.  In the returned summand, if dummies still
        exist, they are going to be treated in the same way as statically-given
        summands.

        The predicate can be a callable going to return a boolean when called
        with same dictionary.  False values can be used the skip some terms.  It
        is guaranteed that the same dictionary will be used for both predicate
        and the summand when they are given as callables.

        For instance, mostly commonly, we can create a tensor by having simple
        summations over symbolic ranges,

        .. doctest::

            >>> dr = Drudge(SparkContext())
            >>> r = Range('R')
            >>> a = Symbol('a')
            >>> b = Symbol('b')
            >>> x = IndexedBase('x')
            >>> v = Vec('v')
            >>> tensor = dr.sum((a, r), (b, r), x[a, b] * v[a] * v[b])
            >>> str(tensor)
            'sum_{a, b} x[a, b] * v[a] * v[b]'

        And we can also give multiple symbolic ranges for a single dummy to sum
        over all of them,

        .. doctest::

            >>> s = Range('S')
            >>> tensor = dr.sum((a, r, s), x[a] * v[a])
            >>> print(str(tensor))
            sum_{a} x[a] * v[a]
             + sum_{a} x[a] * v[a]

        When the objects to sum over are not symbolic ranges, we are in the
        concrete summation mode, for instance,

        .. doctest::

            >>> tensor = dr.sum((a, 1, 2), x[a] * v[a])
            >>> print(str(tensor))
            x[1] * v[1]
             + x[2] * v[2]

        The concrete and symbolic summation mode can be put together freely in
        the same summation,

        .. doctest::

            >>> tensor = dr.sum((a, r, s), (b, 1, 2), x[b, a] * v[a])
            >>> print(str(tensor))
            sum_{a} x[1, a] * v[a]
             + sum_{a} x[2, a] * v[a]
             + sum_{a} x[1, a] * v[a]
             + sum_{a} x[2, a] * v[a]

        Note that this function can also be called on existing tensor objects
        with the same semantics on the terms.  Existing summations are not
        touched by it.  For instance,

        .. doctest::

            >>> tensor = dr.sum(x[a] * v[a])
            >>> str(tensor)
            'x[a] * v[a]'
            >>> tensor = dr.sum((a, r), tensor)
            >>> str(tensor)
            'sum_{a} x[a] * v[a]'

        where we have used summation with only summand (no sums) to create
        simple tensor of only one term without any summation.

        By calling this function, summations according to the Einstein summation

        recognized as a summation, it must appear exactly twice in its
        **original form** in indices, and its range needs to be able to be
        resolved.  When a symbol is suspiciously an Einstein summation dummy but
        does not satisfy the requirement precisely, it will **not** be added as
        a summation, but a warning will also be given for reference.

        For instance, we can have the following fairly conventional Einstein
        form,

        .. doctest::

            >>> dr = Drudge(SparkContext())
            >>> r = Range('R')

            >>> str(tensor)
            'sum_{b} x[a, b]*x[b, c]'

        However, when a dummy is not in the most conventional form, the
        summations cannot be automatically added.  For instance,

        .. doctest::

            >>> tensor = dr.einst(x[a, b] * x[b, b])
            >>> str(tensor)
            'x[a, b]*x[b, b]'

        ``b`` is not summed over since it is repeated three times.  Note also
        that the symbol must be able to be resolved its range for it to be
        summed automatically.

        Note that in addition to creating tensors from scratch, this method can
        also be called on an existing tensor to add new summations.  In that
        case, no existing summations will be touched.
