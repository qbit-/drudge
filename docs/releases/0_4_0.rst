0.4.0
-----

This is mainly a bug-fix release.

* The incomplete simplification problem for Fock drudge is fixed.  Thanks to
  Ethan Qiu for pointing this out.

* The incompetent script for running Spark inside SLURM is removed and got
  improved in the separate `spark-in-slurm` project.

* Spin-1/2 particle-hole drudge now has explicit orbital range sizes.  Thanks to
  Roman Schutski for fixing this.
